Seattle Mobile .NET Developer Group Sessions
========

Welcome to the Main Sessions GitHub for the [Seattle Mobile .NET Developers Groups](http://www.meetup.com/SeattleMobileDevelopers/).

We will meet regularly to explore the use of .NET for building mobile applications. We will focus on multi-platform mobile development, including Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac, Windows Phone, and Windows 8.

This group is targeted at all skill levels, from beginners to experts in .NET looking to explore the mobile space and reuse your existing knowledge. We will have a mixture of presentations, discussions and demos with plenty of opportunities to get to know each other.
